# Project 1: Trend and Seasonality

**Description:** The first project modeled the employment-population ratio of Japan, which is the proportion of all people 15 and older who are employed. The data had a monthly frequency.

1. To explore the idea of capturing the "trend" of the data, I fit a basic polynomial model to the time series, using OLS.
2. To explore seasonality, I performed *manual* monthly seasonal adjustments, both additive and multiplicative.
